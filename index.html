        <div class=\"html\">\n<p>\n  Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean\n  representing whether the string is a palindrome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and\n  backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.\n</p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"CodeEditor-promptParameter\">string</span> = \"abcdcba\"\n</pre>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>\ntrue <span class=\"CodeEditor-promptComment\">// it's written the same forward and backward</span>\n</pre>\n</div>


        <h3>Hints</h3>
        <h4>1</h4>
        <p>\nStart by building the input string in reverse order and comparing this newly built string to the input string. Can you do this without using string concatenations?\n</p>\n
        <h4>2</h4>
        <p>\nCan you optimize your algorithm by using recursion? What are the implications of recursion on an algorithm's space-time complexity analysis?\n</p>\n
        <h4>3</h4>
        <p>\nGo back to an iterative solution and try using pointers to solve this problem: start with a pointer at the first index of the string and a pointer at the final index of the string. What can you do from there?\n</p>
